# QR Component

Built for the first challenge of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

To serve page locally, from within qr-code-component folder

```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
```

ps. I know a page/componenent like this does not need the full force of Vite + Typescript behind it, but it's what I like to use.
